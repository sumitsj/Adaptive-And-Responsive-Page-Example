## Problem Statement

``` 
With the pervasiveness and diversity of mobile devices, as designers we need to cater 
to the variety of screen sizes. This is a challenge that every web and app designer 
currently faces. From the giant corporate monitor to the smartwatch, there are a huge 
number of ways that users can access information online today. Designers looking to 
bridge the gap between devices have two options for their designs: the adaptive site 
or the responsive site.
```

## Adaptive Design

* Crafting Rich Experiences With Progressive Enhancement.

* It uses multiple **fixed layouts**. When the site detects the available space, it selects the layout most appropriate for the screen.

* Ensures the best user experience, as we get full control over design for specific screen size.

* Common screen sizes - 320, 480, 760, 960, 1200, and 1600 pixels.

| Pros  | Cons |
| ------------- | ------------- |
| Allows designers to build the best UX for the appropriate device  | Labor-intensive to create  |
|   | Different layouts on different resolutions |
|   |  Challenging to SEO â€” Search engines have trouble appreciating identical content on multiple sites.    |

## Responsive Design
* Responsive designs respond to changes in browser width by adjusting the placement of design elements to fit in the available space.

* It uses few (less as compared to Adaptive approach) **fluid layouts**.

* It is easier and takes less work to implement, but we get less control over design.

| Pros  | Cons |
| ------------- | ------------- |
| Uniform & seamless  | Less screen size design control  |
| Abundance of templates to use  |   |
| SEO friendly  |   |
| Often easier to implement  |   |

## Conclusion
```
Both responsive and adaptive web designs ensure that your website performs well across
different devices with varying screen resolutions. While responsive design makes your 
website automatically adjust its layout as per the screen resolution, adaptive design 
allows for specialized user experience by distinguishing between mobile and desktop 
versions of the same site.
